what is doctype?
-

what are symentic elements?
- Semantic HTML elements are those that clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way.

> The semantic elements added in HTML5 are:
 `<article>` , `<aside>` , `<footer>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`


what is the output of code ?
```
let a = true;

setTimeout(() => {
  a = false;
}, 2000);

while (a) {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
```
- The code will output "Hello World" indefinitely, as the while loop will continue to run until the value of `a` is set to false. However, the value of `a` will not be set to false until 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds) have passed due to the setTimeout function, so the loop will continue to run and print "Hello World" indefinitely.
